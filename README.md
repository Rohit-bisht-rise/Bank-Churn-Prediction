# Bank-Churn-Prediction
It is a machine learning project which I get in my training and I did it with my understanding.

This is a classification supervised learning problem where I had to predict customer churn rate of the bank(1/0), based on the feature of the past transaction, relationsip with the bank, and some details about the coustomers.

I have used 4 classification prediction models here.
1. Logistic regresssion
2. Decision Tree
3. KNearestNeighbors
4. Random Forest

and at last I have predict the dependent variable by ensembling the top three models.
